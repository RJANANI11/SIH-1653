## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
```1️⃣ Real-time Fraud Detection
✅ Uses AI-driven transaction monitoring to detect anomalies in spending behavior.
 ✅ Flags suspicious activities and alerts users instantly.
 ✅ Integrates behavioral analytics to detect unauthorized access.
2️⃣ Secure Digital Transactions
✅ Implements biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) for safer payments.
 ✅ End-to-end encryption for sensitive data like credit card information.
 ✅ Uses blockchain technology for secure, tamper-proof transaction records.
3️⃣ Cybersecurity Awareness Pop-ups
✅ Displays educational alerts about phishing emails, scams, and password security.
 ✅ Interactive security tests to help users recognize fraudulent websites.
 ✅ Real-time threat level indicators to assess online transaction risk.
4️⃣ Fraud Reporting & Reward System
✅ Users report phishing links or suspicious activities to earn reward points.
 ✅ Points can be redeemed for discounts on financial services (bank fees, insurance, etc.).
 ✅ Encourages user participation in strengthening digital security awareness.
5️⃣ AI-driven Risk Assessment Dashboard
✅ Personalized risk score for users based on online habits and financial behavior.
 ✅ Visual analytics dashboard for financial institutions to track fraud trends.
 ✅ Identifies high-risk accounts and recommends security improvements.```



## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
 📌 AI-based fraud detection module (Real-time transaction scanning).
 📌 User authentication system (Biometric + MFA).
 📌 Threat intelligence database (Updated with new phishing sites & fraud patterns).
 📌 Blockchain-based transaction ledger (Immutable records).
 📌 Web & mobile app integration (For seamless user experience).


## Use Cases
🔹 Use Case 1: A user tries to log in from an unknown device → AI detects risk → Triggers additional verification.
 🔹 Use Case 2: A bank receives multiple fraud complaints → System detects scam trends → Automates security alerts to affected users.
 🔹 Use Case 3: A user receives a suspicious email → Platform scans URL → Alerts user & reports phishing site.
 🔹 Use Case 4: A user enables MFA & biometric login → Earns reward points for securing their account.
